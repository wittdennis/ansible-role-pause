# Pause

Role to pause. Intended to pause between roles.

## Role Variables

```yaml
pause_seconds: 30
```

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: wittdennis.pause, pause_seconds: 60 }
